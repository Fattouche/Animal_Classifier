## Animal Classifier
This project deals with dog breed classification through the use of a convolutional neural network and Google Visual Models.

### Information

All of the code exists in the src directory and each of the root, CNN and Google directories has a README describing its purpose

### Using Tensorflow through docker

1. `docker-compose up` 
2. `docker-compose exec tensorflow bash` will give you a terminal in the container.
3. See that the source code is in the `/notebooks/app` directory.
2. Run different commands to test(train.py for CNN and script.sh for Google)
